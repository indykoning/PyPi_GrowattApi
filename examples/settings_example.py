"""
This is a very trivial script to show how to interface with the configuration settings of a plant and it's inverters
This has been tested against my personal system (muppet3000) which is a hybrid (aka 'mix') inverter system.

Throughout the script there are points where 'pp.pprint' has been commented out. If you wish to see all the data that is returned from those
specific library calls, just uncomment them and they will appear as part of the output.
